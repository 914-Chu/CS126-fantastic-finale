## About

NS-SHAFT is a vertically scrolling platform game. Player can move left or right while falling into the shaft. The game will randomly generate five different kinds of platforms which includes the normal, spikes, conveyor, spring, and fake platforms. Player will regain life whenever they successfully go down one level. The goal is to slowly reach the bottom without being killed by the spikes on the ceiling and platforms or drop directly to the bottom. 

### Normal Platform                  
Allow player to stay on it without any effect.

## Background

The reason why I chose game as my final project was to learn how to build a game from scratch. Since building a game requires various techniques I believe this is a good opportunity for me to gain a better understanding on integrating skills I've learned so far. The NS-SHAFT was a game I used to play a lot when I was a kid. Since the rule, function and graphics of this game are quite straight forward, I think it's a suitable choice for my first game.
